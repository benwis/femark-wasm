# Femark

This is a markdown to html parser and syntax highlighter built using Rust's pulldown-cmark and syntect crate compiled to WASM. Because it is WASM, it's bundle size is a bit large, however it should be both blazingly fast and able to run in edge environments. Benchmarks and additional documentation are a work in progress. PRs are welcome. Very much a WIP

## Install

```sh
npm i @benwis/femark
